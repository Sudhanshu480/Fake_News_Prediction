# Fake_News_Prediction

This is a meticulously developed model aimed at discerning the authenticity of news articles, determining whether they are real or fake. This project utilizes a combination of Logistic Regression and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The process begins by addressing Null values, followed by merging the title and author name into a new column called "content" while simultaneously separating the corresponding labels.

Subsequently, stemming is applied to the text, followed by text vectorization. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, allowing for evaluation and assessment of the model's performance on both. This evaluation helps identify potential issues of overfitting.

Lastly, a predictive model is constructed, enabling the individual verification of news articles for authenticity.
